Small Project 1: Personal Recipe Collection

This project is a simple webpage displaying links to my favorite online recipes with images pulled from their source websites and any modifications to the recipe that I personally make. I like to cook, but right now all my favorite recipes are just stored in a folder in my email which is not the most convenient. 

I wanted to make a simple tool to be able to browse my recipes more visually and make the recipe links more easily accessible. I would like to expand upon this tool later to be able to navigate between the four main categories in the navigation bar, allowing me to better organize the recipes.
